How can you boost the performance of MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines?

To enhance the performance of MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines, you can:

Properly index fields used in $match and $sort stages.

Limit the data processed using $match early in the pipeline.

Use the $project stage to eliminate unnecessary fields early.

Avoid using $out unless necessary, as it forces materialization.

Consider sharding and replication strategies based on workload.




What are the limitations of MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines?

MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines have some limitations, including:

o Limited support for recursive queries.

o Lack of support for joins between collections (use $lookup for limited join functionality).

o Limited textual search capabilities compared to dedicated search engines.

o Aggregation operations are not as flexible as custom JavaScript functions.
