A non-relational database, often known as NoSQL, stores data differently from traditional SQL databases, offering flexibility to manage varied data structures.

Non-relational databases improve performance, support unstructured data, ensure high availability, scale horizontally, enable real-time data processing, offer cost savings, and adapt to diverse use cases, thanks to their various types.

Introduction to BSON (Binary JSON), a binary-encoded format MongoDB uses to store data. Understanding its relationship to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

Creating Documents using the insertOne() and insertMany() methods. Reading Documents using the find() method and its variations like toArray().

Updating Documents using the updateOne() and updateMany() methods. Deleting Documents using the deleteOne() and deleteMany() methods.

Using Multiple Conditions with logical operators like $and, $or, $nor, etc.

Querying Array Fields using operators like $in, $nin, $all, etc. Querying Nested Documents using dot notation for accessing fields in nested documents.

In MongoDB, pagination can be achieved using the skip() and limit() methods. skip() is used to skip a specified number of documents, and limit() restricts the number of documents returned.

$match  is used to filter documents based on specified criteria. $groupis used to group documents by a specified key and applies accumulator expressions to compute aggregated results.

$project is used to reshape documents, includes or excludes fields, and creates computed fields. $sort is used to sort the output documents based on specified fields.

$skip is used to skip a specified number of documents from the beginning of the result set.$limit is used to limit the number of documents in the output.

$unwind is used to deconstruct an array field from the input documents and outputs one document for each element.
